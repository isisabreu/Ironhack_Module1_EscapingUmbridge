      <p> You are a Hogwarts student that spent the last three nights studying for final exams, now that is all over, everything you want is to have a nice meal and drink lots of buttercream beer! You deserve it, but to actually get to Hogsmead you need to dodge from Umbridge and her dementors.
        Use your left and right keys to dodge from obstacles until you get to the Three Broomsticks. </p>
