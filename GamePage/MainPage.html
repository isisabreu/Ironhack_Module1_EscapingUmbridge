        <p>You are a Hogwarts student that spent the last three nights studying for final exams, now that is all over, everything you want is to have a nice meal and drink lots of buttercream beer! 
          You got it! But don't forget to come back school! Dodge from Umbridge and her dementors and get to your room safely.</p>
        <p>Use your 'X' Key to hold yourself in the air with your broom and dodge from obstacles until you get back to Hogwarts. Once you find the castle, move your broom against it to return safely.</p>
