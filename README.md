# Ironhack_Module1_EscapingUmbridge
## Introduction
Escaping Umbridge is a game based on Harry Potter's story in which you need to dodge from obstacles like Dementors and Umbridge clones to get safely to Hogwarts.
In this game we use some techniques learned through the module 1 of Web Delevopment course at Ironhack such as the use of Canvas in js., object orietation and DOM manipulation.
Also basic concepts of HTML and CSS including some animations.
It's a very fun game that requires that the player keeps the attention to hold Harry in the air and also avoid touching the wrong obstacles.
