# Ironhack_Module1_EscapingUmbridge
## Introduction
Escaping Umbridge is a game based on Harry Potter's story in which you need to dodge from obstacles like Dementors and Umbridge clones to get safely to Hogwarts.
In this game we use some techniques learned through the module 1 of Web Delevopment course at Ironhack such as the use of Canvas in js., object orietation and DOM manipulation.
Also basic concepts of HTML and CSS including some animations.
It's a very fun game that requires that the player keeps the attention to hold Harry in the air and also avoid touching the wrong obstacles.

## Game Logic
![Instructions Page](/GamePage/Screenshots/PaginaInicial.png)
This is the main page with instruction on how to succeed within the game and with the main channel to start playing. For this page I used a simple HTML frame with two main divs inside a section so I could move them with flex box. On the CSS stylesheet, the thing that differenciates the format is the animation I've done in the button using hover.

On the game page, I utilize a lot of the canvas and javascript, basically the whole game structure is within a canvas and it works a lot like other obstacle games with open source code (please refer to this lab https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-canvas-flappybirds that served as main inspiration).
